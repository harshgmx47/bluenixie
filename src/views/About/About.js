        <h6>Welcome to the world of The Bluenixie.</h6>
<br/>
<p>
We founded The Bluenixie in November of 2016 as a celebration of pleasure in all its forms. In our creative process—from selecting our materials for their feel as much as their look, to finding the silhouettes and timeless forms that truly feel good on the body—we center our work on the joys of the sensual world.
<br/>
<br/>
To honor our commitment to craftsmanship and the pleasure of lived experience, we partner with carefully selected family-owned factories and  to ensure our garments uphold our values of ethical and sustainable production. Whether you’ve made this purchase for a special occasion or to make everyday an occasion, we hope you find as much pleasure in wearing our garments as we have had in creating them. Show us how you make it your own @bluenixie.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
We can’t wait to see you.
